# Titanic EDA Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset to understand which factors affected passenger survival. I used Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean the data, make graphs, and write down key observations.

## Files in this project:

Titanic EDA.ipynb – My Jupyter Notebook with all the code and visualizations

Titanic Dataset (train).csv – The main dataset used for analysis

Titanic Dataset (test).csv – Extra data for future use or model building

## What I did:

Checked the data using .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts()

Cleaned missing values and removed duplicates

Made graphs to show survival patterns by gender, class, age, and fare

Used heatmaps and pairplots to find relationships between features

Wrote simple observations for each graph

Summarized the findings at the end

## Tools used:

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn
